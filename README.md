# My Project: DNA Sequence Editor

**What will the application do & why is it of interest to me?**
This software will allow the user to add a DNA sequence to a Sequence collection. The name, author, specific part 
(promoter, CDS, etc) will be able to be denominated by the user. It will allow the user to add MoClo and/or BioBrick 
flanks to the sequence. It will tell the user if the input sequence contains an invalid character i.e. !(A,G,C,T). 
Lastly, it will translate the DNA sequence into a protein sequence (polypeptide). 

Why? I am passionate about the intersection of *synthetic biology* and *programming* and I believe that 
computation will allow future researchers to tap into and ethically modify *the code of life*.

**Who will use it?**
- Researchers: Synthetic Biologists, Geneticists, etc 
- Students and undergraduate biology/chemistry clubs
- Synthetic Biology enthusiasts and hobbyists

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add a DNA sequence to a DNA list. I want to be able to specify
the name, the nucleotide sequence, and organism of origin.
- As a user, I want to be able to see my list, and choose a DNA sequence to modify.
- As a user, I want to be able to add MoClo flanks to my DNA sequences.
- As a user, I want to be able to see DNA sequence translated into a protein sequence.
